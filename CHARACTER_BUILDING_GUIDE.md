## 📊 Item Quality & Substats

Items come in 5 rarities, each with different substat counts:

- **Common**: 2 substats (weak rolls)
- **Uncommon**: 2 substats (moderate rolls)
- **Rare**: 3 substats (good rolls)
- **Epic**: 3 substats (strong rolls)
- **Legendary**: 4 substats (powerful rolls)

### 🎲 Why Substats Matter
**Substats are EXTREMELY important!** Test results show:
- Epic quality gear beats Common quality **100% of the time**
- Even with same set bonuses, better substats = guaranteed wins
- Grinding for high-quality items is essential for competitive builds

### Substat Types:
- **Flat Stats**: attack, defense, HP, energy
- **Percentage Stats**: attack%, defense%, hp%
- **Crit Stats**: crit rate, crit damage
- **Special**: luck (affects dodge, counter, proc rates)

---

## ⚖️ Build Balance Summary

### Win Rates (50-Battle Test Results):
- **6-Piece Builds**: 58% win rate
- **3+3 Builds**: 42% win rate

**Both strategies are viable!** Choose based on your playstyle:

### Choose Full 6pc If You Want:
- Consistent, predictable power
- Specialized role (pure tank, pure DPS, pure crit)
- Simpler gearing process
- Strong passive bonuses

### Choose 3+3 Mixed If You Want:
- Explosive reaction procs
- Adaptive gameplay
- Versatile stat coverage
- Unique Dual Mastery builds

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Set Bonuses < Item Quality**: A full set of Common items will LOSE to mixed Epic items
2. **Substats Matter Most**: With nerfed set bonuses, your substat rolls are crucial
3. **Adaptive Triggers**: 3+3 builds can unlock multiple adaptive bonuses simultaneously
4. **Stat Synergy**: Full sets naturally roll complementary stats (Cryo = crit, Geo = defense)
5. **Proc Chances**: Reactions have 25-50% proc rates - they will happen frequently!
6. **Keep Grinding**: Always look for better substats even if you have the right sets
